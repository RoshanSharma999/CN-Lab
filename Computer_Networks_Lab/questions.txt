(1) Write a program for implementing the error detection technique for data transfer in unreliable
network code using CRC (16-bits) Technique.

(2) Given a graph of 5 nodes A to E, find shortest paths from any node as source to all other
nodes using Distance vector routing.

(3) Given a graph of 5 nodes A to E, find shortest paths from any node as source to all other
nodes using Link state routing.

(4) Packets from different flows arrive at a switch or router for processing. A good scheduling
technique treats the different flows in a fair and appropriate manner. Implement priority
queuing as a technique to improve Quality of Service.

(5) Write a program to achieve Traffic management at Flow level by implementing Leaky Bucket
Algorithm.

(6) Using TCP/IP sockets, write a client-server program to make client send the file name and
the server to send back the contents of the requested file name “sample.txt” with the following
contents: “Hello we are at Computer Networks Lab” Display suitable error message in case
the file is not present in the server.

Note: How to run/test Q6

g++ cn6_server.cpp -o server
g++ cn6_client.cpp -o client

In one terminal:
./server
In other terminal:
./client
